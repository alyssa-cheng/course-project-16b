    <p>This website will be using Rank Choice Voting (RCV) data to explain different voting systems!</p>
    <p>There are 2 fairness criteria that you would want from a system:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA):</li>
        <li>Pareto Efficiency (PE):</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The only voting system that satisfies these criteria is dictatorship</p>
